# Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository contains my personal learning examples as I explore machine learning concepts with Google's Gemini. I'm documenting my progress and code implementations as I learn.

## Examples Completed

### Linear Classifiers
My first implementation in `linear-classifiers-code-example.py` demonstrates:
- Creating sample data using scikit-learn
- Implementing a Perceptron using SGDClassifier
- Training a linear classifier
- Inspecting model parameters (weights and bias)
- Making predictions with the trained model

## Notes to Self

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

### Running the Examples
```bash
python linear-classifiers-code-example.py
```
